# Data Structure and Algorithm â€“ Code Collection

This repository contains well-organized implementations of commonly used **Data Structures** and **Algorithms** in C/C++. The goal is to help learners strengthen their DSA foundations through practical coding examples and structured folders.

## Why This Repository?

Understanding how data is stored and processed is crucial for efficient programming and technical interviews. This repository will help you:

- Learn common linear and non-linear data structures
- Practice algorithms with clear code samples
- Improve coding skills for competitive programming and placements
- Build a solid foundation for system-level and software development

## ðŸ”§ How to Use This Repository

- Clone the repo:  
  `git clone https://github.com/GK-CPP/Data-Structure-And-Algorithm.git`

- Navigate to any folder and open `.cpp` files with your preferred IDE (VS Code, Code::Blocks, etc.)

- Compile and run using a C++ compiler:  
  `g++ filename.cpp -o output && ./output`

- Modify input values to explore more test cases and scenarios


## ðŸ’¡ Learning Tips

- Focus on **why** a structure is used, not just how
- Compare time and space complexities between implementations
- Draw memory diagrams to understand pointer behavior in linked structures
- Practice converting recursive logic to iterative where possible
- Use online judges to practice problems that use these structures and algorithms
